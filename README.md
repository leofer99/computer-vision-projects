# Computer Vision Projects
Series of computer vision projects.

## 1. Object Tracking Project
This project implements a real-time hand motion tracking and event detection system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It can detect and analyze hand movements in video footage to recognize specific events like picking up objects, passing a probe through a piece, making a marking on the piece, and placing the piece in a box.
