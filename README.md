# Computer Vision Projects
Series of Computer Vision Projects. See inside each folder for more details.

## 1. Object Tracking Project
This project implements a real-time hand motion tracking and event detection system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It can detect and analyze hand movements in video footage to recognize specific events like picking up objects, passing a probe through a piece, making a marking on the piece, and placing the piece in a box.

## 2. Image Denoising
Implemented methods for noise reduction in images, including Anisotropic Diffusion and Markov Random Fields. Used a VDSR (Very Deep Super-Resolution) CNN model for image super-resolution.

## 3. Image Segmentation
Performed Semantic Segmentation. Used Markov Random Fields approaches.

## 4. Image Colorization
Trained a ResNet18-based colorization model on the CIFAR-10 dataset to generate colored images from grayscale inputs.

## 5. Static Saliency + Learnable Attention
Implemented static saliency detection techniques using OpenCV.  
Visualized attention maps from a ViT pretrained on ImageNet.
